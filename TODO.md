# TODO

In no particular order

* Postings should have tags
* Postings should display company logo (if available)

* New postings should ensure valid fields
* Flash/status messages should show successful/unsuccessful actions

* Postings list should be searchable
* Postings list should be paginated

* Site errors should be logged/counted
* Site should be integrated with analytics (Google, internal, mixpanel, etc..)

* Stripe keys should live outside codebase

## JMD

* I left in all bootstrap less files just in case we want to add any other magic - the build does not use it all
* The bootstrap JS needs to be optimized to eleminate extra plugins
* Mobile still needs some love ;)
* Multi-user seed data would be helpful for dev
* Inactive posts can be viewed by anyone?
* Signout option?
* If we use jobs.js.la/ can we get rid of the redirect to /jobs?
